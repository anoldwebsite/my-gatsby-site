This is one of my favourite book written by Ernest Hemingway. I have read this book a few times and I have watched its movie twice. Earnet Hemmingway was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. 
Some of his novels that ***I should read*** are:

* A Farewell to Arms
* The Sun Also Rises
* For Whom The Bell Tolls
