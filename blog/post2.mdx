This is one of my favourite book written by my favourite author Charles Dickens. I have read this book five times and I have watched its movie a few times. I used to show the movie to my students too in order to make it easier for them to read the text of the novel.
Some of his novels that ***I should read*** are:

* David Copperfield
* Sketches by Boz
* Nicholas Nickleby
